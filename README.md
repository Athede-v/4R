# 4R
A Cool Sign In Way (Avoiding From Brute Force Attacks)

Hello And Welcome To 4R Sing In Way :)
This code provides a very basic and minimalistic password authentication system that relies on the user inputting characters at specific positions in their password. It is not suitable for real-world security purposes and should be considered a learning exercise. For real-world applications, more robust and secure authentication methods should be used, such as hashing and salting passwords, implementing rate limiting, and using secure protocols like HTTPS.
Also You can marge with high secure protocols.

- [CLI](#cli)
- [GUI](#gui)

## CLI
   1. Clone The Repository
   ```
 git clone https://github.com/Athede-v/4R.git && 
cd 4R
   ```
   2. Go To CLI Dir
   ```
     cd .\4R\
     cd .\CLI\
   ```
   3. Run app.py (-python 3.11)
   ```
     py app.py
   ```

   This The Way How it Works 
   You Can Be More Creative (I Mean You Can Change Code And Add It Some Protect Protocol To It And Make A Strong And Very Safe 4R)
   
     X-X-X-X
     1-5-8-1
   
   This Is Template Of The CLI So At First Enter Your 8-Char Password By 
    `$UR >>> set pass`
   Command , Type In The Console And Press Enter
   
   And Then You Can Test 4R Sign In Way BY
    `$UR >>> run`
   Command , Just Type In The Console And Press Enter Bro 
   
   -Some Options Are Active At The Moment For More Security (You Can Remove And Replace Your Code Or Change Any Thing You Want , It Just A Very Simple Code)
   
   Type `exit` To Exit 
   So Have Fun :) (@athede-v)
   
   `app.js` `app.cpp` `app.dart` are like `app.py` but in another language with same function.
   And I Almost Forgot `.\CLI\simple.py` is a cleaner and less text code but the function is same 
   `simple.py` is a clean code for better understanding if i was code dirty in `app.py`

## GUI
   1. Clone The Repository
   ```
 git clone https://github.com/Athede-v/4R.git && 
cd 4R
   ```
   2. Go To GUI Dir
   ```
     cd .\4R\
     cd .\GUI\
   ```
   3. Install Packages
   ```
     npm install
   ```
   4. And Start Test Server
   ```
     npm start
   ```
   5. Go To `http://localhost:3000/` URL
